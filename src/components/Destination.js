Situated at an altitude of around 12,500 ft above the sea level the barren mountains over here change their hues every second and it is definitely a sight to behold. The tiny villages over here under the shadow of huge mountains have a population of around 35 to 200 people. This sparsely inhabited land is a slice of paradise for all those whoâ€™re yearning to cut off from the intoxicating city life. "
